# MBA PROJECT- KNOWLEDGE AWARENESS, MEDIATING ROLE TOWARDS INTENTION TO USE RIDE-HAILING SERVICES IN GHANA

Ride-hailing, a digital innovation has emerged as a transformative force, reshaping the way individuals navigate their daily lives within a contemporary urban landscape. Leading giants such as Uber, Bolt, and Lyft among others have positioned this mode of transportation at the forefront of modern mobility solutions. However, some challenges are associated with the use of ride-hailing services specifically in developing countries like Ghana. Bearing this in mind, knowledge awareness serving as a mediating role driving the intention to use ride-hailing becomes very important since it informs the perception and intentions of users of the ride-hailing services.

## Problem Statement
The urban regions of Ghana have seen the introduction of new transport services employing Information Communication Technology (ICT) and digital innovation.  Uber, Bolt, and Yango are some examples of ride-hailing services in Ghana providing top-notch transport services to customers. The existence of these ride-hailing services emphasizes the demand for alternative transportation options and demonstrates how digital innovation can offer sustainable transport solutions. Ride-hailing services provide access to transportation for people who do not own a car or who cannot drive for various reasons, such as age, disability, or financial constraints. Ride-hailing services are favored by individuals due to their convenience and affordability in comparison to alternative transportation choices (Pham et al., 2017). Ride-hailing services are convenient for people who need to travel quickly or at odd hours, as they can be easily accessed through mobile applications and offer on-demand services. 

Additionally, ride-hailing reduces travel time and allows individuals to avoid the challenge of finding parking in busy areas (Lavieri & Bhat, 2019). Ride-hailing services are generally considered safer than traditional taxis, as they often use GPS tracking and have systems for monitoring drivers and passengers movement. The ride-hailing platform encourages a system where two to three individuals can drive a particular car allowing the car to be used throughout the day (Damle, 2018). This results in maximum asset utilization. Ride-hailing services have also provided jobs, especially for the youth. Ride-hailing services have led to technological advancements in the transportation sector, such as the use of mobile applications, GPS tracking, and real-time updates. However, empirical studies exploring the factors that drive the intention to use ride-hailing services specifically in developing countries such as Ghana are limited. 

Research conducted by Acheampong et al. (2020) research on the determinants of car-sharing adoption among young adults in Ghana found that attitude, perceived benefits, travel, and other socio-demographic factors were the main drivers for adopting car-sharing. Similarly, previous studies have identified factors such as performance expectance, social influence, effort expectance, hedonic motivation, and habit as key determinants of acceptance and usage of ride-hailing services (Almunawar et al., 2021). However, beyond these factors, knowledge and awareness of digital innovation are also important for the adoption and use of ride-hailing services. Knowledge awareness is also essential for riders to make informed decisions while using ride-hailing services. Knowledge awareness according to Engelmann (2009) is described as an individual’s state of being informed and having perceived information about others or an activity. Riders must be aware of the cost, the perceived ease of use of the service, the perceived usefulness, destination accessibility, and the safety concerns associated with patronizing ride-hailing services.  

The study therefore identifies specific determining factors that drive the use of ride-hailing services in Ghana. Mainly the contribution of this would look at knowledge awareness as a mediating factor to explain the adoption and usage of ride-hailing services in Ghana.
The concept of knowledge awareness explores the state of users being informed and having perceived information about how ride-hailing service affect their intention to use such services. Beyond knowledge awareness of cost, destination accessibility, safety, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use affect a passenger's selection of a ride-hailing service. Hence, knowledge awareness as a mediating factor significantly affects the choice and selection of a ride-hailing service.


This research seeks to address the following questions:

     1. What are the factors driving the use of ride-hailing services in Ghana? 

     2. What are the challenges associated with ride-hailing services in Ghana?

     3. How is knowledge awareness a mediating factor in the use of ride-hailing services in Ghana?
